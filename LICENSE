   “Entity” means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, governmental authority, non-profit organization, or other organization (whether for-profit or not-for-profit).  

   “Non-Commercial Purposes” means use that does not directly or indirectly generate revenue, provide paid services, or support the business operations of any Entity. Academic publication fees, conference registration fees, or nominal cost-recovery charges by non-profit educational institutions are not considered commercial.

3. Non-Commercial Restriction  
   The license granted in Section 1 is **expressly conditioned** on the licensee’s use being limited to Non-Commercial Purposes. Any use by or on behalf of an Entity, or any use that facilitates commercial activity (including but not limited to integration into a paid product, SaaS offering, internal business workflow, or monetized research), is **prohibited** unless the Copyright Holder grants separate written permission.

4. Copyleft & License Preservation  
   4.1 Any Derivative Work must be distributed **exclusively** under this exact License (version 1.2 or later if the Copyright Holder publishes an update and the licensee elects to adopt it).  
   4.2 The full text of this License must be included in every copy or substantial portion of the Software or Derivative Work.

7. Commercial Licensing  
Entities requiring a commercial license may request one by written notice to the Copyright Holder. Silence or failure to respond does **not** constitute permission.

8. No Warranty; Limitation of Liability  
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
